## üß© **STATIC BLOCK ‚Äì COMPLETE INTERVIEW GUIDE**

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ When does a static block execute?**

- A **static block** executes **once** when the **class is loaded** into JVM memory.
- Executed **before main()**, constructors, or any instance methods.
- Only runs **once per class loader**.

```java
class Demo {
    static { System.out.println("Static Block"); }
    public static void main(String[] args) {}
}
```

üß† _Concept:_ JVM calls a hidden `<clinit>()` method to execute static initializers during class loading.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Can a class have multiple static blocks?**

‚úÖ Yes, a class can have **multiple static blocks**, and they execute **in the order of appearance** in the source code.

```java
class Test {
    static { System.out.println("Block 1"); }
    static { System.out.println("Block 2"); }
}
```

üß† _Output:_

```
Block 1
Block 2
```

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Can we have a static block without a main method?**

- **Java ‚â§ 6:** static blocks execute even without `main()`.
- **Java 7+ (modern Java):** JVM checks for `main()` first ‚Üí class won‚Äôt run without it.

```java
class Demo {
    static { System.out.println("Static block"); }
}
```

üß† _Java 8+ Output:_

```
Error: Main method not found in class Demo
```

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Can a static block access instance variables or methods?**

‚ùå No.
Static blocks run **before objects are created**, so instance members are **not available**.

```java
class Example {
    int x = 10;
    static {
        // System.out.println(x); // ‚ùå Compile-time error
    }
}
```

üß† _Reason:_ Instance variables belong to an object; static context has no instance reference (`this`).

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Can a static block call static methods or access static variables?**

‚úÖ Yes, since both belong to the class (not objects).

```java
class Example {
    static int count = 5;
    static {
        System.out.println(count);
        print();
    }
    static void print() { System.out.println("Static method called"); }
}
```

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Can a static block be used to initialize static variables?**

‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî it‚Äôs often used for **complex initialization** logic that can‚Äôt be done in a single statement.

```java
static int x;
static {
    x = 10;
    x *= 2;
}
```

üß† _Note:_ Simple initialization can be done inline, but for I/O, calculations, or conditions ‚Äî use static block.

---

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Can a static block throw exceptions?**

‚ùå **Checked exceptions** ‚Äì not allowed (compile error).
‚úÖ **Unchecked exceptions** ‚Äì allowed (runtime error).

```java
static {
    try {
        throw new IOException(); // ‚ùå Compile error
    } catch (IOException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
```

üß† _Reason:_ The compiler-generated `<clinit>()` can‚Äôt have a `throws` clause.

---

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ What is the difference between a static block and a static method?**

| Feature               | Static Block                   | Static Method     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| Execution             | Automatic during class loading | Called explicitly |
| Return type           | None                           | Has a return type |
| Exception declaration | Cannot use `throws`            | Can use `throws`  |
| Purpose               | Initialization                 | Reusable logic    |

---

### **9Ô∏è‚É£ Can static blocks exist inside inner classes?**

‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî but only in **static nested classes**.

```java
class Outer {
    static class Inner {
        static { System.out.println("Static block inside Inner"); }
    }
}
```

üß† _Note:_ Non-static inner classes cannot have static blocks because they are tied to an instance of the outer class.

---

### **üîü Can an interface have a static block?**

‚úÖ Since Java 8, interfaces can have **static methods**, and those methods can initialize static variables.

```java
interface I {
    static int x = init();
    static int init() {
        System.out.println("Interface static init");
        return 10;
    }
}
```

üß† _When the interface is loaded, static initialization runs automatically._

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ In what order do static blocks, instance blocks, and constructors execute?**

**Order of execution:**

1. Static blocks ‚Üí when class loads (once)
2. Instance initialization block ‚Üí when object is created (every time)
3. Constructor ‚Üí after instance block

```java
class Demo {
    static { System.out.println("Static"); }
    { System.out.println("Instance"); }
    Demo() { System.out.println("Constructor"); }
}
```

üß† _Output:_

```
Static
Instance
Constructor
```

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Can we load a class without executing its static block?**

‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî by using `ClassLoader.loadClass()` instead of `Class.forName()`.

```java
Class.forName("MyClass"); // Executes static block
ClassLoader.getSystemClassLoader().loadClass("MyClass"); // Does NOT
```

üß† _Reason:_ `Class.forName()` triggers both loading + initialization; `loadClass()` only loads.

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ What happens if a static block throws a runtime exception?**

‚û°Ô∏è The JVM wraps it inside an **ExceptionInInitializerError**, and class initialization fails.

```java
class Example {
    static {
        int x = 5 / 0;
    }
}
```

üß† _Output:_

```
ExceptionInInitializerError: java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero
```

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Can a subclass access parent class static block variables?**

‚úÖ Yes, if they are `public` or `protected`.

üß† _Static initialization order:_

1. Parent class static block
2. Child class static block

```java
class Parent {
    static { System.out.println("Parent static"); }
}
class Child extends Parent {
    static { System.out.println("Child static"); }
}
```

üß† _Output:_

```
Parent static
Child static
```

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Can we use return statements in static blocks?**

‚ùå No.
`return` can only appear in methods or constructors, not in static or instance initializer blocks.

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ Can static blocks be synchronized?**

‚ùå You can‚Äôt declare a static block with `synchronized`, but
‚úÖ you can **synchronize inside** it.

```java
static {
    synchronized (Demo.class) {
        System.out.println("Thread-safe initialization");
    }
}
```

üß† _Note:_ Class loading itself is thread-safe in JVM, so you rarely need this.

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ What‚Äôs the difference between static block and static variable initialization?**

| Concept    | Static Variable      | Static Block                              |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Simplicity | For direct values    | For complex logic                         |
| Timing     | At class load        | Immediately after variable initialization |
| Example    | `static int x = 10;` | `static { x = compute(); }`               |

üß† _Order:_ Static variable initializers run **before** the static block.

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ Can static blocks load native libraries?**

‚úÖ Yes.
Used to load JNI libraries before native method calls.

```java
static {
    System.loadLibrary("myNativeLib");
}
```

üß† _Note:_ Without loading the native library, JNI methods would fail at runtime.

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ Can we control the order of static block execution across multiple classes?**

‚úÖ Yes ‚Äî depends on **which class is referenced first**.

```java
class A { static { System.out.println("A"); } }
class B { static { System.out.println("B"); } }

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        B b = new B(); // "B" runs before "A"
    }
}
```

üß† _If B references A (e.g., via static field), then A‚Äôs static block runs first._

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ What happens if multiple threads load a class with static blocks?**

JVM ensures **thread-safe class initialization**.
Only one thread executes the static block; others wait until it finishes.

üß† _Guarantee:_ Class initialization is atomic ‚Äî JVM locks the Class object during `<clinit>()`.

Would you like me to create a **concise one-page ‚ÄúStatic Block Interview Cheat Sheet‚Äù (PDF)** with these points ‚Äî perfect for last-minute revision before interviews?

A static block in Java cannot throw checked exceptions because there is no mechanism to handle or declare them during class loading.[1][5]

### Why Checked Exceptions Are Disallowed

- Static blocks are executed when the class is loaded by the JVM, not during normal program flow.[5][1]
- Because static blocks are not invoked from normal code (they‚Äôre executed by the JVM automatically), there is nowhere to specify a `throws` clause in the associated method signature.[4][6][5]
- If a checked exception were allowed to escape a static block, there would be no code able to catch and handle it, possibly causing the program to fail during class loading.[8][1]
- Java‚Äôs design ensures that checked exceptions are only used where code can catch or declare them, which isn‚Äôt possible for static initialization blocks.[1][5]

### What Happens Instead

- Static blocks may throw unchecked exceptions (like `RuntimeException`), which will be wrapped in an `ExceptionInInitializerError` by the JVM if not caught.[6][9][1]
- Checked exceptions must be caught within the static block itself using a try-catch, but cannot be thrown out of the block to the class loader.[2][3]
- Attempting to throw a checked exception leads to a compilation error.[5][6]

### Summary Table

| Exception Type | Can be thrown from static block? | Can be caught inside block? |            Can propagate outside block?             |
| -------------- | :------------------------------: | :-------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: |
| Checked        |            No [6][5]             |         Yes [2][3]          |                      No [2][1]                      |
| Unchecked      |          Yes [1][6][5]           |           Yes [2]           | Yes (wrapped as ExceptionInInitializerError) [1][9] |

The restriction on checked exceptions for static blocks ensures safe class loading and avoids unhandled errors that would compromise class initialization.[6][8][1][5]
