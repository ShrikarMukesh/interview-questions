Great one üëç You‚Äôre asking about **Optimistic Locking vs Pessimistic Locking** (typo: ‚Äúpecific‚Äù ‚Üí you meant **Pessimistic**).
Both are **concurrency control mechanisms** in Spring Data JPA / Hibernate to avoid conflicts when multiple transactions update the same row.

---

# üîπ 1. Optimistic Locking

- **Idea**: Assume **no conflicts will happen**.
- Before committing, Hibernate checks if the record was modified by another transaction.
- Uses a **version field** (`@Version`) to detect conflicts.

‚úÖ Example:

```java
@Entity
public class Order {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    private String status;

    @Version   // Hibernate manages this column
    private Integer version;
}
```

When transaction updates:

```sql
UPDATE orders
SET status = 'SHIPPED', version = version + 1
WHERE id = ? AND version = ?
```

üëâ If another transaction updated the row in between, the `WHERE` clause fails ‚Üí Hibernate throws `OptimisticLockException`.

### When to use?

- Low contention systems (conflicts are rare).
- Improves performance (no DB-level locks).
- Safer for web apps with lots of reads.

# üîπ 2. Pessimistic Locking

- **Idea**: Assume **conflicts will happen**.
- Locks the row in DB when it‚Äôs read ‚Üí other transactions must wait.
- Prevents dirty reads and lost updates.

‚úÖ Example in Spring Data JPA:

```java
public interface OrderRepository extends JpaRepository<Order, Long> {

    @Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE) // Acquires row-level lock
    @Query("SELECT o FROM Order o WHERE o.id = :id")
    Order findByIdForUpdate(@Param("id") Long id);
}
```

This translates to:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE id = ? FOR UPDATE;
```

üëâ Other transactions trying to read/write this row must **wait** until the lock is released (commit/rollback).

### Lock Types

- `PESSIMISTIC_READ` ‚Üí Shared lock, prevents updates but allows reads.
- `PESSIMISTIC_WRITE` ‚Üí Exclusive lock, prevents reads & writes.
- `PESSIMISTIC_FORCE_INCREMENT` ‚Üí Similar to optimistic, but forces version increment.

### When to use?

- High contention systems (many concurrent updates).
- Critical consistency (e.g., financial transactions).
- But can cause **deadlocks** or **performance bottlenecks**.

# üîπ Quick Comparison

| Feature            | **Optimistic Locking**                | **Pessimistic Locking**              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Strategy**       | Assume no conflicts, detect on commit | Assume conflicts, prevent by locking |
| **Implementation** | `@Version` field                      | `@Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_*)`  |
| **Performance**    | Faster, no DB locks                   | Slower, uses DB locks                |
| **Conflicts**      | Detected at commit (throws exception) | Prevented (other transactions wait)  |
| **Best Use Case**  | Low contention, web apps              | High contention, financial apps      |

---

‚úÖ **Rule of thumb**:

- Use **Optimistic Locking** for most cases ‚Üí scalable, fewer locks.
- Use **Pessimistic Locking** only when **data integrity is more important than performance**.
