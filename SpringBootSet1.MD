Ah, **circular dependency** in Spring Boot is a common issue that trips up many developers, even experienced ones. Let’s go step by step to understand it clearly, its causes, detection, and ways to fix it.

---

## **1. What is Circular Dependency?**

A **circular dependency** occurs when **two or more Spring beans depend on each other directly or indirectly**, creating a cycle that Spring cannot resolve.

**Example:**

```java
@Component
public class A {
    private final B b;

    @Autowired
    public A(B b) {
        this.b = b;
    }
}

@Component
public class B {
    private final A a;

    @Autowired
    public B(A a) {
        this.a = a;
    }
}
```

Here:

- `A` depends on `B`
- `B` depends on `A`

Spring cannot instantiate either bean because it needs the other first → **circular dependency error**.

---

## **2. How Spring Handles Circular Dependencies**

- **Field injection / setter injection** can handle circular dependencies because Spring can create the bean first and then inject the dependencies later.
- **Constructor injection** (like above example) **cannot handle circular dependencies** by default because the dependencies are needed at construction time.

Spring will throw:

```
Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanCurrentlyInCreationException:
Error creating bean with name 'a': Requested bean is currently in creation: Is there an unresolvable circular reference?
```

---

## **3. Detecting Circular Dependencies**

Spring Boot detects circular dependencies **at startup**.

- Check the **stack trace** in the logs; it will usually point to the beans involved.
- In modern Spring Boot versions (2.6+), **circular references are disabled by default**, so constructor injection cycles will fail fast.

---

## **4. How to Fix Circular Dependencies**

### **A. Use `@Lazy` Annotation**

Inject the dependency lazily so Spring doesn’t need it immediately:

```java
@Component
public class A {
    private final B b;

    @Autowired
    public A(@Lazy B b) {
        this.b = b;
    }
}

@Component
public class B {
    private final A a;

    @Autowired
    public B(@Lazy A a) {
        this.a = a;
    }
}
```

- `@Lazy` tells Spring to create the bean only when needed → breaks the circular initialization at startup.

---

### **B. Use Setter Injection Instead of Constructor Injection**

```java
@Component
public class A {
    private B b;

    @Autowired
    public void setB(B b) {
        this.b = b;
    }
}

@Component
public class B {
    private A a;

    @Autowired
    public void setA(A a) {
        this.a = a;
    }
}
```

- Spring can create the beans first and inject the dependencies later → resolves circular dependency.

---

### **C. Refactor to Remove Circular Dependency**

- Often the **best solution** is to **rethink the design**.
- Example: Extract the shared functionality into a **third bean** `C`:

```java
@Component
public class C {
    public void commonMethod() {}
}

@Component
public class A {
    private final C c;
    @Autowired
    public A(C c) { this.c = c; }
}

@Component
public class B {
    private final C c;
    @Autowired
    public B(C c) { this.c = c; }
}
```

- Now, `A` and `B` no longer depend on each other directly.

---

### **D. Enable Circular References (Not Recommended)**

Spring Boot 2.6+ disables circular references by default. You can enable it in `application.properties`:

```properties
spring.main.allow-circular-references=true
```

- This **should be avoided** in production, better to refactor or use `@Lazy`.

---

## ✅ **Key Takeaways**

1. Constructor-based injection + circular dependency = startup failure.
2. `@Lazy` or setter injection can solve it temporarily.
3. Refactoring to remove the circular dependency is the **best practice**.
4. Circular dependencies often indicate **tight coupling** → bad design.
